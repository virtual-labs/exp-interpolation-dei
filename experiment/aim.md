The primary aim of this experiment is to explore the concept of interpolation and apply various systematic numerical methods to estimate the value of a function at intermediate points using both evenly spaced and unevenly spaced data.

Interpolation serves as a fundamental tool in numerical analysis, enabling the prediction of unknown values within the range of known data points. For evenly spaced points, methods such as Newton’s Forward and Backward Interpolation are widely used due to their efficiency and structured approach. In the case of unevenly spaced points, methods like Lagrange’s Interpolation and Newton’s Divided Difference are employed, offering flexibility and generality in handling arbitrary data distributions.

Through this experiment, the objective is not only to perform interpolation but also to understand:

The underlying principles of interpolation and how data distribution (even or uneven spacing) affects the choice of method.

The differences between polynomial-based methods, including their advantages, limitations, and computational efficiency.

The significance of interpolation in practical applications, such as engineering, computer graphics, weather forecasting, and scientific simulations.

By performing this experiment, students will develop problem-solving skills in numerical computation, gain deeper insights into the strengths and limitations of different interpolation techniques, and appreciate the importance of interpolation in bridging discrete data with continuous analysis in real-world scenarios.
