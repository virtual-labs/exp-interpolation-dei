### About the Experiment  

This experiment deals with the study and implementation of interpolation techniques for estimating unknown values of a function between known data points. It covers methods such as Newton’s Forward and Backward Difference interpolation for evenly spaced points, and Lagrange’s interpolation for unevenly spaced data points. Through this experiment, students learn how interpolation provides a powerful tool for numerical approximation, curve fitting, and solving practical scientific and engineering problems where direct analytical solutions are not feasible.
