## Aim of the Experiment  

The aim of this experiment is to **explore the concept of interpolation** and apply various systematic numerical methods to estimate the value of a function at intermediate points using both **evenly spaced** and **unevenly spaced** data.

## Introduction  

Interpolation serves as a fundamental tool in numerical analysis, enabling the prediction of unknown values within the range of known data points.  

- For **evenly spaced points**, methods such as *Newton’s Forward* and *Backward Interpolation* are widely used due to their efficiency and structured approach.  
- For **unevenly spaced points**, methods like *Lagrange’s Interpolation* and *Newton’s Divided Difference* are employed, offering flexibility and generality in handling arbitrary data distributions.

## Expected Outcomes  

By performing this experiment, students will:  

- Develop **problem-solving skills** in numerical computation.  
- Gain deeper insights into the **strengths and limitations** of different interpolation techniques.  
- Appreciate the importance of interpolation in bridging **discrete data with continuous analysis** in real-world scenarios.
